# form_and_input
Forms and inputs
## Getting Started
In the above code i used form widget to create a form under stateful widget because we have to change the form content that’s why i am using stateful widget here, here means in MyForm class.
Before it, I have taken a variable _formkey and declared it as global. There are some string variables and methods that will be used when the button will be clicked (onPressed).

TextFormFiels: is used to take input from the user in form.
InputDecoration: is used to decorate the textFormField like icon, labelText,hintText etc.
labelText: is used to set labels.
hintText: is used to set hints for users to help them enter input and understanding.
I am also using a button(Elevated Button) and set a text as submit  into the button, when it is clicked its content/text will be displayed as submitted.
In this code I am not using form validation. It’s only a simple form without validation.
